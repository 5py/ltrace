* TODO
** Automatic prototype discovery:
*** Use debuginfo if available
    Alternatively, use debuginfo to generate configure file.
*** Demangled identifiers contain partial prototypes themselves
** Automatically update list of syscalls?
** Improve documentation
*** Describe syntax of config files
** Update /etc/ltrace.conf
   In particular, we could use a config directory, where packages
   would install their ltrace config scripts.  The config file could
   be named after SONAME, and automatically read when corresponding
   library is mapped.
** More operating systems (solaris?)
** Get rid of EVENT_ARCH_SYSCALL and EVENT_ARCH_SYSRET
** Implement displaced tracing
   A technique used in GDB (and in uprobes, I believe), whereby the
   instruction under breakpoint is moved somewhere else, and followed
   by a jump back to original place.  When the breakpoint hits, the IP
   is moved to the displaced instruction, and the process is
   continued.  We avoid all the fuss with singlestepping and
   reenablement.
** Create different ltrace processes to trace different children
** Config file syntax
*** typedef should be able to assign a lens to a name
*** format should take arguments like string does
* BUGS
** After a clone(), syscalls may be seen as sysrets in s390 (see trace.c:syscall_p())
