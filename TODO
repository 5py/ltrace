* BFD:
  + Read debugging info from executables/libraries
* Automatically update list of syscalls?
* Improve documentation
* Display different argument types
* Update /etc/ltrace.conf
* More operating systems (solaris?)
* Get rid of EVENT_ARCH_SYSCALL and EVENT_ARCH_SYSRET
* Cleaner way to use breakpoints:
  + BP is placed in the PLT
  + When control hits there:
    - write down return address
    - change return address with another one (handled by ltrace)
    - get arguments...
    - change the process' PC to be in the correct place,
      without removing breakpoint
  + When control hits one of our return addresses:
    - get return value...
    - change PC to the right place
* Create different ltrace processes to trace different children
* After a clone(), syscalls may be seen as sysrets in s390 (see trace.c:syscall_p())
